# Interloop

Interloop is an independently developed mobile game. Interloop is a two-dimensional action and puzzle game that revolves around connecting nodes to form enclosed loops
to achieve a win condition under limited time.
The scripts and visuals are implemented with C# and High Level Shader Language within the Unity engine.

The game utilizes a wide range of custom made algorithms covering aspects such as level generation and solving complex geometrical problems. 
Most notably, a novel algorithm was created that efficiently checks whether an arbitrary, potentially self-intersecting polygon satisfies a unique gameplay condition.
