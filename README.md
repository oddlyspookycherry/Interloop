# Interloop

Interloop is a two-dimensional action-puzzle game where players connect nodes to form enclosed loops and meet a win condition under time pressure. Developed independently, the game is built using C# for scripting and High-Level Shader Language (HLSL) for visuals within the Unity engine.

Developing Interloop was a significant learning experience, particularly in creating custom geometric algorithms for tasks such as level generation and collision detection. One of the key challenges was designing an efficient algorithm that checks whether an arbitrary, potentially self-intersecting polygon encloses a given point.

Additionally, working on Interloop taught me to think in a more modular way. It pushed me to apply object-oriented programming principles and software design patterns to manage the growing complexity of the project.
